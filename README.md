# Motivation for Safari

This is a Safari version of a [Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/motivation/ofdgfpchbidcgncgfpdlpclnpaemakoj) created by [maccman](https://github.com/maccman). [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/maccman/motivation) here. In order to add this extension to Safari, you need to modify the Date value containing your dob in `app.js`, and then build a new `Motivation.safariextz` extension. This requires an Apple Dev Account and a signed Safari Dev certificate.

(This extension is currently hard-coded to my birthday, due to issues with the date-picker not showing up in Safari.)
